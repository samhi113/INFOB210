a) The program calculates LCM or GCF, and how many times a letter appears in a certain passage
b) Two parts: 1) Two numbers and LCM or GCF 2) Passage number and letter to find
c) Two parts: 1) LCM or GCF answer 2) # of times letter appears
d) Two are used predominantly: Conditional: try/catch while checking for letters Repeated: While loops while calculating lcm/gcf
e) Searching for letters coud probably be streamlined, but for right now all I know is enough to kill a Windows ME computer.
