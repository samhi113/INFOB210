b) Inputs: Question 1: Amount paid, Order total Question 2: Original Value, Original Units, and New Units

c) Outputs: Question 1: Amount paid, Order Total, Value of Change, and each bill and coin amount Question 2: Original Value, Unit converted to, and New Value

d) Sequential for going from hundred dollar bills to pennies. Conditional for error statements and checking which conversion to run. Repeated for each time I convert to a new bill or coin for change.

e) I could use a function to automate the change conversions, as they were very similar.
