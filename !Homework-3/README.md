1. This program is split in two: a) Part 1 takes a user-provided grade and evaluates it on the A-F scale b) Part 2 takes a user-provided month and evaluates it for the days in that month
2. This program takes 2 inputs: a) Part 1 takes a grade (i.e. 100, 0.87, A) b) Part 2 takes a month (i.e. January, Jan, 1)
3. This program puts out 2 things: a) Part 1 outputs the grade on the A-F scale b) Part 2 outputs the days in the month
4. This program uses 3 types of execution: a) Sequential: The if/elif for the grades works most specific to least, in order to allow the top grades to get an A and not assign them an F. b) Conditional: The try/catches for both parts allows for the numbers to be parsed, unless an error occurs. c) Repeated: The if/elif for months is the same, but with small variations for each month.
5. This program could be improved by compiling the repeated sections into a much more simplified manner, probably a function call for the month if/elif statements
